# State & Todo's
As it was my first Angular Project, I ran into several issues which caused me some headaches and took some time to accomplish. And I'm still hanging on some points.

So far there is a list, that shows the active jobs. Next to the list is a panel where detailed information on a selected job ***should*** be displayed. And this is main **Todo** point. 
- Displying the details of a selected job. 

When this is done some 
- styling on the singel elements

has to be applied too.
